Selena Gomez
In the late aughts, Selena Gomez started her career as a teenage actress starring in a hit Disney Channel series. However, she soon showed that her musical talents were perhaps even stronger, as she piled up hit singles such as "Come & Get It," "Good for You," and "Same Old Love" from her first two chart-topping albums. Initially, she broke from her child actress mold with the pop/rock band Selena Gomez & the Scene, issuing a trio of albums from 2009 to 2011. After going solo, she scored a pair of number ones with Stars Dance (2013) and Revival (2015), before continuing her reinvention as a cool electronic pop vocalist with chart-climbing collaborations with Kygo ("It Ain't Me") and Marshmello ("Wolves").
