  <p>Bolstering her place in pop’s hot property with her female-forward hits and co-signed to Major Toms/Asylum, former 3 x world karate champion Anne-Marie has collaborated with a wealth of household names over her career to date including Rudimental, a band whom she toured the world with as their lead vocalist for two years, and Clean Bandit. Featuring on the trio’s monster track “Rockabye” at the end of 2016, she spent nine weeks at the top of the UK charts which became the longest-running UK No.1 in 22 years!</p>
