  <p> 17-year-old global pop-phenom Billie Eilish has fast become one of the biggest stars to emerge in since the release of her debut single “ocean eyes,” and continues to shatter the ceiling of music with her genre-defying sound. Fast forward from her humble breakout, Billie’s album WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? debuted at #1 in the Billboard 200 in the U.S, as well as in the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Finland and many more. It is now the biggest North American debut of the decade (male, female or group), shifting 313,000 units in the first week and has already hit NUMBER 1 in the Billboard 200 album 3 times since its release in March, earning Billie more than 15 billion combined streams worldwide to date. Billie is currently on her sold-out WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WORLD TOUR.</p>
