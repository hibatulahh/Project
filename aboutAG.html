          <h1>Ariana Grande</h1>
      <p>A television star turned pop diva, Ariana Grande emerged in the mid-2010s as an heir to the throne of Mariah Carey. Blessed with powerful vocals that belied her petite frame, Grande had greater singing chops than many of her peers, and her Babyface-produced 2013 debut, Yours Truly, underscored her debt to '90s soul. Nevertheless, her music was flexible enough to incorporate hip-hop and EDM, as proved by her 2014 smash hit single "Problem," featuring Iggy Azalea.</p>
